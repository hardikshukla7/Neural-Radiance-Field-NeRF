# Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

## About NeRF

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is an innovative technique in computer vision and graphics that generates highly realistic 3D models of scenes using a sparse set of 2D images. NeRF employs a neural network to approximate the volumetric scene function, effectively modeling how light interacts with a 3D environment, including reflection and refraction. By training on multiple images captured from different angles, NeRF can synthesize novel views of a scene that were not part of the original input.

## Project Overview

This project features a NeRF representation trained on the Lego dataset, showcasing the algorithm's capability to capture intricate details and produce realistic 3D visualizations.

### Results

After training for 3000 iterations, the final Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value and the target image are as follows:
