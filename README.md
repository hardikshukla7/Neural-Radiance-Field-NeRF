**NeRF**

About NeR: Neural Radiance Fields, a technique in computer vision and graphics for generating highly realistic 3D models of scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. NeRF uses a neural network to approximate the volumetric scene function, which models how light interacts with a 3D scene, including how it reflects and refracts. By training on multiple images from different angles, NeRF can synthesize novel views of a scene that were not part of the original input.

The Jupyter Notebook above features a NeRF representation trained on the Lego dataset, which includes intricate details to demonstrate the efficiency of the NeRF algorithm.

The final PSNR value and the target image after 3000 iterations are:
